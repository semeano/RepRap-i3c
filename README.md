# RepRap-i3c
RepRap 3D printer frame. Inspired on the [iTopie](http://reprap.org/wiki/ITopie) and [Prusa i3 box](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3#Box_Style_Frame) frames.

### Why?
Because in order to build an i3 or iTopie you'll need a CNC router to cut the frame.
You could use an i3 box frame version but isn't that good looking. Plus, wood is cheaper (hence the "c" on the name) than threaded rods.
