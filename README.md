# RepRap-i3c
RepRap 3D printer frame. Inspired on the [iTopie](http://reprap.org/wiki/ITopie) and [Prusa i3 box](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3#Box_Style_Frame) frames.

### Why?
Because in order to build an i3 or iTopie you'll need a CNC router to cut the frame.
You could use an i3 box frame version but isn't that good looking. Plus, threaded rods are more expensive than wood.

### Requirements
You'll need [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/).
